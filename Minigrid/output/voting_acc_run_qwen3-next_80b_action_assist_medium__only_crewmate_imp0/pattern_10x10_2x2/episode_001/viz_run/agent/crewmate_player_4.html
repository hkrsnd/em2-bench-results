Front tile is floor. Best action suggestion is OPEN_DOOR (9). There's a closed door (D) at front position R11(11,11)? Wait, let me check the ascii_patch. The ascii_patch shows rows: [\"XX#P...XX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"####D####\", \"XX#.↑....\", \"XX#....T.\", \"XX#.....T\", \"XXD......\", \"X.#....T.\"]. The center is R11(12,11), and direction is LEFT (103). So front tile should be to the left of (12,11), which is (11,11). Looking at the ascii_patch rows: the row for y=11 is the 5th row (index 4) which is \"XX#.↑....\". The center is at (12,11), so the character at the center is '↑' which is the player facing up? Wait, no. The ascii_patch legend says \"↑\": \"you facing UP\". But in the current observation, the direction is 103 (LEFT), so the player should be facing left, which would be '←'. But the ascii_patch shows '↑' at the center? That doesn't match. Let me re-read the ascii_patch. The ascii_patch rows are given as a list of strings. The center is R11(12,11), and the radius is 4. So the rows are from y=11-4=7 to y=11+4=15? Let's index the rows. The first row is y=7, second y=8, etc. The center is at row 4 (index 4) and column 4 (index 4) of the 9x9 grid. The ascii_patch rows: [\"XX#P...XX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"####D####\", \"XX#.↑....\", \"XX#....T.\", \"XX#.....T\", \"XXD......\", \"X.#....T.\"]. The center is the 5th row (index 4) and 5th character (index 4). The 5th row is \"XX#.↑....\". Let's count the characters: X X # . ↑ . . . . -> positions 0 to 8. So index 4 is '↑'. But the player is facing LEFT (103), so the symbol should be '←', not '↑'. This is confusing. Maybe the ascii_patch is showing the player's current direction as '↑' but the direction is 103? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the direction is 103 which is LEFT, so the player should be facing left, which is '←'. But the ascii_patch shows '↑' at the center. That must be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the ascii_patch is showing the player's direction as '↑' but the direction is actually UP? But the SELF INFORMATION says direction is 103 (LEFT).

Front tile is floor. Need to navigate to long_task_7 at R01(4,14). BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is OPEN_DOOR (9), but front tile is floor, not door. However, TASK_NAVIGATION_SUGGESTION_ACTIONS indicates 'long_task_7': 9, which might mean we need to open a door near the task. But front tile is floor, so OPEN_DOOR is invalid. Let's check the visible_tasks: long_task_7 is at R01(4,14). We need to move towards it. Since we're at R10(11,3), and direction is LEFT, moving forward (left) is towards decreasing x. But we need to check if there's a door in front. Current front tile is floor, so OPEN_DOOR is invalid. BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is [9], but it's invalid because front tile is not 'D'. So we should use the next best action. Looking at the path, we need to go left and up? Let's see the grid. From the ascii_patch: rows are from top to bottom. The center is R10(11,3). The rows are: [\"#########\", \".XX#.....\", \"...#.....\", \"...O←....\", \"...#.....\", \".XX#.....\", \"XXX#PT...\", \"XXX#.....\"] The center is at the 4th row (index 3) and 5th character (since radius=4, so 9x9 grid). The center is '←' which is us facing left. The front tile is the tile to the left of us. In the row \"...O←....\", the center is at the '←', so the character before it is 'O' (open door) and after is '.'? Wait, let's parse the ascii_patch. The ascii_patch has 8 rows, each of 9 characters. The center is R10(11,3), which is the middle of the 9x9 grid. The rows are: row0: \"#########\" (9 chars) row1: \".XX#.....\" row2: \"...#.....\" row3: \"...O←....\" -> here, the center is at the middle of this row. Since it's 9 chars, the middle is index 4. So row3: index0: '.', index1: '.', index2: '.', index3: 'O', index4: '←', index5: '.', index6: '.', index7: '.', index8: '.'? Wait, no: the string is \"...O←....\" which is 9 characters: [0:'.', 1:'.', 2:'.', 3:'O', 4:'←', 5:'.', 6:'.', 7:'.', 8:'.'] So the center (us) is at (row=3, col=4) in the patch. The front tile (left) is the tile to the left of us, which is at col=3 in row3: that's 'O' (open door). But wait, the direction is 102 (LEFT), so front is left. So front tile is the tile to the left of us. In the patch, at row3, col=3 is 'O'. So front_tile is 'O'. But in the current observation, the front_tile should be 'O'. However, in the allowed actions, we have OPEN_DOOR (9) as an option.

Front tile is floor. TASKS_TO_COMPLETE has long_task_7 at R01(4,14). BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is OPEN_DOOR (9), but front tile is floor, not door. Need to move toward long_task_7. Current position R00(6,9), direction DOWN. Looking at ascii_patch: row 4 has '....↓...#' where ↓ is at (6,9). Next row is '####O####' which has an open door at (6,10)? Wait, let's check the ascii_patch rows. Rows are from top to bottom. Center is R00(6,9). The rows are: [\"T.......#\", \"........#\", \"........#\", \"..TT....#\", \"....↓...#\", \"####O####\", \"XXX...XX#\", \"XXX..TXX#\", \"XX.....X#\"]. The center is at row 4 (0-indexed row 4), column 4. So the center is the '↓' in the 5th row (index 4). The row index 5 is \"####O####\", which is the row below the center. So front tile (down from center) is at row 5, column 4. In the string \"####O####\", the 4th character (0-indexed) is 'O'. So front tile is 'O' (open door). But wait, the direction is 101 (DOWN), so front is (6,10). The ascii_patch row 5 (index 5) is \"####O####\", and the center is at (6,9) which is row 4, column 4. So the front tile (down) is row 5, column 4. In the string \"####O####\", the characters are: index 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '#', 4: 'O', 5: '#', 6: '#', 7: '#', 8: '#'? Wait, the string is 9 characters long. Let's count: \"####O####\" has 9 characters. So positions: 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '#', 4: 'O', 5: '#', 6: '#', 7: '#', 8: '#'. So at column 4 (which is the center column), the front tile is 'O'. So front_tile is 'O'. Therefore, OPEN_DOOR (9) is valid because front tile is 'O'.
