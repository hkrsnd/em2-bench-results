let&#x27;s see the ascii_patch: rows[4] has &#x27;←&#x27; at center, and the row is &#x27;xxx#←....&#x27; so front is wall. turning right would face right (east), which might have open space. but let&#x27;s check the ascii_patch: the center is r10(11,9) and the row is &#x27;xxx#←....&#x27; meaning the character at the center is &#x27;←&#x27; (facing left), and the tile to the left (front) is &#x27;#&#x27; (wall). the tile to the right (relative to current direction) would be the next column to the right? wait, let&#x27;s parse the ascii_patch properly. the ascii_patch is a 9x9 grid centered at r10(11,9). the rows are: [&quot;xxx#.....&quot;, &quot;xxx#.t...&quot;, &quot;xxx#.....&quot;, &quot;xxx#...t.&quot;, &quot;xxx#←....&quot;, &quot;#####o###&quot;, &quot;xxx#xxpxx&quot;, &quot;xxx#xx..x&quot;, &quot;xxx#xxx..&quot;] the center is the middle of the 9 rows. so row index 4 (0-based) is the center row. the center row is &quot;xxx#←....&quot;. the center character is the &#x27;←&#x27; which is at the middle of the string. the string has 9 characters. so positions: index 0: &#x27;x&#x27;, 1: &#x27;x&#x27;, 2: &#x27;x&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;←&#x27;, 5: &#x27;.&#x27;, 6: &#x27;.&#x27;, 7: &#x27;.&#x27;, 8: &#x27;.&#x27; so the center is at (4,4) in the patch. the front (left) is the tile to the left of center, which is index 3: &#x27;#&#x27; (wall). the right of center is index 5: &#x27;.&#x27; (floor). so if we turn right, we face right (100), then front would be the tile to the right of current position, which is the &#x27;.&#x27; at (12,9) in the grid? wait, let&#x27;s map the coordinates. current position is r10(11,9). the direction is 102 (left), so front is (11-1,9) = (10,9). the ascii_patch shows that at the center row (which is the row of current position), the character at the center is &#x27;←&#x27; (so the current position is the center). the tile to the left (front) is the character at the left of the center in the string, which is index 3: &#x27;#&#x27; (wall). the tile to the right (relative to current direction) would be the tile to the right of the center in the string, which is index 5: &#x27;.&#x27; (floor). but when we turn right, our direction becomes 100 (right), then the front tile would be the tile to the right of current position, which is (12,9). in the ascii_patch, the center row (row 4) has at index 5: &#x27;.&#x27; so that tile is walkable. so turning right would make front tile &#x27;.&#x27; which is walkable. alternatively, turning left would face down (101), then front would be (11,10). in the ascii_patch, the row below center (row 5) is &quot;#####o###&quot;. the center of that row is the middle character. the center of the patch is row 4, so row 5 is the next row down. the string for row 5: &quot;#####o###&quot;. the center of the patch is at (4,4) for the center row. so for row 5, the character at column 4 (the center column) is &#x27;o&#x27;? let&#x27;s see: the string is 9 characters: index 0: &#x27;#&#x27;, 1: &#x27;#&#x27;, 2: &#x27;#&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;o&#x27;, 5: &#x27;#&#x27;, 6: &#x27;#&#x27;, 7: &#x27;#&#x27;, 8: &#x27;#&#x27;?

no: &quot;#####&quot; is 5, then &#x27;o&#x27;, then &#x27;###&#x27; is 3, total 9. so indices: 0: &#x27;#&#x27;, 1: &#x27;#&#x27;, 2: &#x27;#&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;#&#x27;, 5: &#x27;o&#x27;, 6: &#x27;#&#x27;, 7: &#x27;#&#x27;, 8: &#x27;#&#x27;?

wait, the center column of the patch is index 4. so for row 5, the character at index 4 is the fifth character of the string. the string &quot;#####o###&quot; has: index0: &#x27;#&#x27;, index1: &#x27;#&#x27;, index2: &#x27;#&#x27;, index3: &#x27;#&#x27;, index4: &#x27;#&#x27;, index5: &#x27;o&#x27;, index6: &#x27;#&#x27;, index7: &#x27;#&#x27;, index8: &#x27;#&#x27; so at row 5, column 4 (center column) is &#x27;#&#x27; (because index4 is the fifth character, which is &#x27;#&#x27;). the &#x27;o&#x27; is at index5. so the tile at (11,10) in the grid? current position is r10(11,9). down from current position is (11,10). in the ascii_patch, the row below center (row 5) and column 4 (center column) is the tile directly below the center. so the tile at (11,10) is the character at row 5, column 4 of the patch, which is &#x27;#&#x27; (because index4 of the string is &#x27;#&#x27;). but the &#x27;o&#x27; is at row 5, column 5 (index5). so the tile to the south of current position is &#x27;#&#x27; (wall), and the tile to the southeast? actually, the ascii_patch shows the entire 9x9 area. the center is (11,9). the patch rows: row0: turn_right r10(11,9) short_task_2'><summary>Step 300 · pos R10(11,9) · dir 102 · action TURN_RIGHT · assigned 1/3 remaining · minDist 9</summary><div class='thought'>Facing LEFT (102).

So row index 4 (0-based) is the center row. The center row is &quot;XXX#←....&quot;. The center character is the &#x27;←&#x27; which is at the middle of the string. The string has 9 characters. So positions: index 0: &#x27;X&#x27;, 1: &#x27;X&#x27;, 2: &#x27;X&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;←&#x27;, 5: &#x27;.&#x27;, 6: &#x27;.&#x27;, 7: &#x27;.&#x27;, 8: &#x27;.&#x27; So the center is at (4,4) in the patch. The front (left) is the tile to the left of center, which is index 3: &#x27;#&#x27; (wall). The right of center is index 5: &#x27;.&#x27; (floor). So if we turn right, we face right (100), then front would be the tile to the right of current position, which is the &#x27;.&#x27; at (12,9) in the grid? Wait, let&#x27;s map the coordinates. Current position is R10(11,9). The direction is 102 (LEFT), so front is (11-1,9) = (10,9). The ascii_patch shows that at the center row (which is the row of current position), the character at the center is &#x27;←&#x27; (so the current position is the center). The tile to the left (front) is the character at the left of the center in the string, which is index 3: &#x27;#&#x27; (wall). The tile to the right (relative to current direction) would be the tile to the right of the center in the string, which is index 5: &#x27;.&#x27; (floor). But when we turn right, our direction becomes 100 (RIGHT), then the front tile would be the tile to the right of current position, which is (12,9). In the ascii_patch, the center row (row 4) has at index 5: &#x27;.&#x27; so that tile is walkable. So turning right would make front tile &#x27;.&#x27; which is walkable. Alternatively, turning left would face down (101), then front would be (11,10). In the ascii_patch, the row below center (row 5) is &quot;#####O###&quot;. The center of that row is the middle character. The center of the patch is row 4, so row 5 is the next row down. The string for row 5: &quot;#####O###&quot;. The center of the patch is at (4,4) for the center row. So for row 5, the character at column 4 (the center column) is &#x27;O&#x27;? Let&#x27;s see: the string is 9 characters: index 0: &#x27;#&#x27;, 1: &#x27;#&#x27;, 2: &#x27;#&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;O&#x27;, 5: &#x27;#&#x27;, 6: &#x27;#&#x27;, 7: &#x27;#&#x27;, 8: &#x27;#&#x27;? Wait, the string is &quot;#####O###&quot; which is 9 characters: positions 0-4: &#x27;#&#x27;, then &#x27;O&#x27; at index 5? Wait, no: &quot;#####O###&quot; has 9 characters: # # # # # O # # # -&gt; so index 0: &#x27;#&#x27;, 1: &#x27;#&#x27;, 2: &#x27;#&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;#&#x27;, 5: &#x27;O&#x27;, 6: &#x27;#&#x27;, 7: &#x27;#&#x27;, 8: &#x27;#&#x27;? Actually, the string is &quot;#####O###&quot; which is 5 &#x27;#&#x27; then &#x27;O&#x27; then 3 &#x27;#&#x27;? Wait, let&#x27;s count: &quot;#####O###&quot; -&gt; 5 &#x27;#&#x27; then &#x27;O&#x27; then 3 &#x27;#&#x27;? No: &quot;#####&quot; is 5, then &#x27;O&#x27;, then &#x27;###&#x27; is 3, total 9. So indices: 0: &#x27;#&#x27;, 1: &#x27;#&#x27;, 2: &#x27;#&#x27;, 3: &#x27;#&#x27;, 4: &#x27;#&#x27;, 5: &#x27;O&#x27;, 6: &#x27;#&#x27;, 7: &#x27;#&#x27;, 8: &#x27;#&#x27;? Wait, no: &quot;#####O###&quot; has 9 characters: the first five are &#x27;#&#x27; (indices 0-4), then &#x27;O&#x27; at index 5, then &#x27;###&#x27; at indices 6-8. So at row 5 (which is the row below center), the center column (index 4) is the fifth character? Wait, the center column of the patch is index 4. So for row 5, the character at index 4 is the fifth character of the string. The string &quot;#####O###&quot; has: index0: &#x27;#&#x27;, index1: &#x27;#&#x27;, index2: &#x27;#&#x27;, index3: &#x27;#&#x27;, index4: &#x27;#&#x27;, index5: &#x27;O&#x27;, index6: &#x27;#&#x27;, index7: &#x27;#&#x27;, index8: &#x27;#&#x27; So at row 5, column 4 (center column) is &#x27;#&#x27; (because index4 is the fifth character, which is &#x27;#&#x27;). The &#x27;O&#x27; is at index5. So the tile at (11,10) in the grid? Current position is R10(11,9). Down from current position is (11,10). In the ascii_patch, the row below center (row 5) and column 4 (center column) is the tile directly below the center. So the tile at (11,10) is the character at row 5, column 4 of the patch, which is &#x27;#&#x27; (because index4 of the string is &#x27;#&#x27;). But the &#x27;O&#x27; is at row 5, column 5 (index5). So the tile to the south of current position is &#x27;#&#x27; (wall), and the tile to the southeast? Actually, the ascii_patch shows the entire 9x9 area. The center is (11,9). The patch rows: row0: </div><details class='sub' open><summary>Assigned tasks (remaining) — 1</summary><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>pos</th><th>progress</th><th>steps</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>short_task_2</td><td>R01(7,14)</td><td>0/8</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table></details><details class='sub' open><summary>Assigned tasks (completed) — 2</summary><div class='mono'>long_task_15, common_task_3</div></details><details class='sub'><summary>Minimap</summary><pre class='minimap'>#####################

Front tile is wall (#). Cannot move forward. Need to turn to face a walkable direction. BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is TURN_LEFT (4), but turning left from LEFT would face DOWN (101). However, TURN_RIGHT (5) would face RIGHT (100), which might have walkable tiles. Check visible tiles: ascii_patch shows walls on left (front) and right? Let's see the ascii_patch: rows[4] has '←' at center, and the row is 'XXX#←....' so front is wall. Turning right would face right (east), which might have open space. But let's check the ascii_patch: the center is R10(11,9) and the row is 'XXX#←....' meaning the character at the center is '←' (facing left), and the tile to the left (front) is '#' (wall). The tile to the right (relative to current direction) would be the next column to the right? Wait, let's parse the ascii_patch properly. The ascii_patch is a 9x9 grid centered at R10(11,9). The rows are: [\"XXX#.....\", \"XXX#.T...\", \"XXX#.....\", \"XXX#...T.\", \"XXX#←....\", \"#####O###\", \"XXX#XXPXX\", \"XXX#XX..X\", \"XXX#XXX..\"] The center is the middle of the 9 rows. So row index 4 (0-based) is the center row. The center row is \"XXX#←....\". The center character is the '←' which is at the middle of the string. The string has 9 characters. So positions: index 0: 'X', 1: 'X', 2: 'X', 3: '#', 4: '←', 5: '.', 6: '.', 7: '.', 8: '.' So the center is at (4,4) in the patch. The front (left) is the tile to the left of center, which is index 3: '#' (wall). The right of center is index 5: '.' (floor). So if we turn right, we face right (100), then front would be the tile to the right of current position, which is the '.' at (12,9) in the grid? Wait, let's map the coordinates. Current position is R10(11,9). The direction is 102 (LEFT), so front is (11-1,9) = (10,9). The ascii_patch shows that at the center row (which is the row of current position), the character at the center is '←' (so the current position is the center). The tile to the left (front) is the character at the left of the center in the string, which is index 3: '#' (wall). The tile to the right (relative to current direction) would be the tile to the right of the center in the string, which is index 5: '.' (floor). But when we turn right, our direction becomes 100 (RIGHT), then the front tile would be the tile to the right of current position, which is (12,9). In the ascii_patch, the center row (row 4) has at index 5: '.' so that tile is walkable. So turning right would make front tile '.' which is walkable. Alternatively, turning left would face down (101), then front would be (11,10). In the ascii_patch, the row below center (row 5) is \"#####O###\". The center of that row is the middle character. The center of the patch is row 4, so row 5 is the next row down. The string for row 5: \"#####O###\". The center of the patch is at (4,4) for the center row. So for row 5, the character at column 4 (the center column) is 'O'? Let's see: the string is 9 characters: index 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '#', 4: 'O', 5: '#', 6: '#', 7: '#', 8: '#'? Wait, the string is \"#####O###\" which is 9 characters: positions 0-4: '#', then 'O' at index 5? Wait, no: \"#####O###\" has 9 characters: # # # # # O # # # -> so index 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '#', 4: '#', 5: 'O', 6: '#', 7: '#', 8: '#'? Actually, the string is \"#####O###\" which is 5 '#' then 'O' then 3 '#'? Wait, let's count: \"#####O###\" -> 5 '#' then 'O' then 3 '#'? No: \"#####\" is 5, then 'O', then '###' is 3, total 9. So indices: 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '#', 4: '#', 5: 'O', 6: '#', 7: '#', 8: '#'? Wait, no: \"#####O###\" has 9 characters: the first five are '#' (indices 0-4), then 'O' at index 5, then '###' at indices 6-8. So at row 5 (which is the row below center), the center column (index 4) is the fifth character? Wait, the center column of the patch is index 4. So for row 5, the character at index 4 is the fifth character of the string. The string \"#####O###\" has: index0: '#', index1: '#', index2: '#', index3: '#', index4: '#', index5: 'O', index6: '#', index7: '#', index8: '#' So at row 5, column 4 (center column) is '#' (because index4 is the fifth character, which is '#'). The 'O' is at index5. So the tile at (11,10) in the grid? Current position is R10(11,9). Down from current position is (11,10). In the ascii_patch, the row below center (row 5) and column 4 (center column) is the tile directly below the center. So the tile at (11,10) is the character at row 5, column 4 of the patch, which is '#' (because index4 of the string is '#'). But the 'O' is at row 5, column 5 (index5). So the tile to the south of current position is '#' (wall), and the tile to the southeast? Actually, the ascii_patch shows the entire 9x9 area. The center is (11,9).
