The character at row 4, column 4 is &#x27;→&#x27;, which means facing RIGHT. But SELF INFORMATION says Direction: 103 (UP). This is inconsistent. Wait, the SELF INFORMATION says: Direction: 103. But the ascii_patch shows &#x27;→&#x27; at center, which is facing RIGHT (100). So there&#x27;s a mistake. Let me re-read the SELF INFORMATION: </div><details class='sub' open><summary>Assigned tasks (remaining) — 2</summary><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>pos</th><th>progress</th><th>steps</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>common_task_3</td><td>R10(12,6)</td><td>0/3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>long_task_11</td><td>R10(14,8)</td><td>0/13</td><td>13</td></tr></tbody></table></details><details class='sub' open><summary>Assigned tasks (completed) — 1</summary><div class='mono'>short_task_1</div></details><details class='sub'><summary>Minimap</summary><pre class='minimap'>#####################

TASKS_TO_COMPLETE is empty, so no task to do. Previous steps showed oscillation between (13,8) and (13,9) with MOVE_FORWARD and MOVE_BACKWARD. To avoid oscillation, I should move forward to explore new area. Moving forward will take me to (13,10) which is walkable and not previously visited in recent steps. However, the current step shows oscillation alert, so I need to break the loop by changing direction or moving to a different path. Since front tile is walkable, moving forward is still valid, but I should check if there&#x27;s a better action to avoid oscillation. Looking at the ascii_patch, the area below (13,10) might be blocked or have a door. Let me check the ascii_patch rows: row 4 is &#x27;X#...T...&#x27; which means at (13,10) it&#x27;s floor, but row 5 is &#x27;###O#####&#x27; which is a door. However, the front tile is currently floor, so moving forward is safe. But to avoid oscillation, I should not just keep moving forward and backward. Maybe I should turn right or left to explore a different direction. The ascii_patch shows that to the right (east) there might be more open space. Let me check the current direction: facing down (101). Right would be east (100). So turning right might allow me to move east and explore new areas. Alternatively, I could turn left to west, but the ascii_patch shows walls on the left side. Looking at the ascii_patch rows: the first character is &#x27;X&#x27; which is unseen, then &#x27;#&#x27; for wall. So the left side is blocked. The right side might be open. Let me check the ascii_patch for the current position. The center is R10(13,9), and the rows are from row -4 to +4 relative to center. The center row is &#x27;X#..↓....&#x27; which means at (13,9) we are facing down. The row above center (row -1) is &#x27;X#...T...&#x27; which is row 8 of the grid? Wait, the ascii_patch rows are listed as: [&quot;X#.....T.&quot;, &quot;X#.T...T.&quot;, &quot;X#.......&quot;, &quot;X#...T...&quot;, &quot;X#..↓....&quot;, &quot;###O#####&quot;, &quot;X#.XXXXXX&quot;, &quot;X#.XXXXXX&quot;, &quot;X#XXXXXXX&quot;] and the center is the 5th row (index 4) which is &#x27;X#..↓....&#x27;. So the center is at row 4, column 4 (since it&#x27;s a 9x9 patch). The &#x27;↓&#x27; is at the center of the patch, so the center is (13,9). The rows are: row0: X#.....T. -&gt; columns 0-8: X # . . . . . T . row1: X#.T...T. row2: X#....... row3: X#...T... row4: X#..↓.... -&gt; here, the &#x27;↓&#x27; is at column 4, so the center is (13,9). row5: ###O##### row6: X#.XXXXXX row7: X#.XXXXXX row8: X#XXXXXXX Now, the front tile is at (13,10) which is row4, column5. In row4: &#x27;X#..↓....&#x27; -&gt; the characters are: index0: &#x27;X&#x27;, index1: &#x27;#&#x27;, index2: &#x27;.&#x27;, index3: &#x27;.&#x27;, index4: &#x27;↓&#x27;, index5: &#x27;.&#x27;, index6: &#x27;.&#x27;, index7: &#x27;.&#x27;, index8: &#x27;.&#x27; So front tile is &#x27;.&#x27; (floor). But looking at row5: &#x27;###O#####&#x27; -&gt; this is the row below the center (since center is row4, row5 is one down). So at (13,10) is floor, but below that (13,11) is part of row5. In row5, the columns: index0: &#x27;#&#x27;, index1: &#x27;#&#x27;, index2: &#x27;#&#x27;, index3: &#x27;O&#x27;, index4: &#x27;#&#x27;, index5: &#x27;#&#x27;, index6: &#x27;#&#x27;, index7: &#x27;#&#x27;, index8: &#x27;#&#x27; So at (13,11) the tile is &#x27;#&#x27;? Wait, no. The row5 is for y=10? Let&#x27;s map the coordinates. The center is R10(13,9). The ascii_patch rows are from y=9-4=5 to y=9+4=13? But the rows are listed as 9 rows. The center row is the 5th row (index 4) which is the row for y=9. So: row0: y=5 row1: y=6 row2: y=7 row3: y=8 row4: y=9 (center) row5: y=10 row6: y=11 row7: y=12 row8: y=13 Now, the front tile is at (13,10) which is x=13, y=10. In the ascii_patch, for row5 (y=10), the columns: index0: &#x27;X&#x27; -&gt; x=9? Wait, the ascii_patch is a 9x9 grid centered at (13,9). So the x range is from 13-4=9 to 13+4=17. y range from 9-4=5 to 9+4=13. So: row0 (y=5): x=9 to 17: </div><details class='sub' open><summary>Assigned tasks (remaining) — 0</summary><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>pos</th><th>progress</th><th>steps</th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></details><details class='sub' open><summary>Assigned tasks (completed) — 3</summary><div class='mono'>short_task_1, common_task_3, long_task_11</div></details><details class='sub'><summary>Minimap</summary><pre class='minimap'>#####################

Front tile is floor. Need to move toward common_task_3 (R10(12,6)) or long_task_11 (R10(14,8)). BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is STRAFE_LEFT (3), which for direction RIGHT means moving UP (since right_vector for RIGHT is DOWN, so STRAFE_LEFT is UP). However, moving UP from (11,13) would go to (11,12), which is in the ascii_patch row 4 (index 4) as '→' but wait, the ascii_patch shows the center as R11(11,13) and the rows are from top to bottom. Let me parse the ascii_patch correctly. The ascii_patch rows are: [\"XXX#X..XX\", \"#####O###\", \"XXX#...P.\", \"XXX#....T\", \"XXX#→....\", \"XXXO.P...\", \"X..#....T\", \"..X#.....\", \".XX#.....\"]. The center is R11(11,13), so the row index 4 (5th row) is \"XXX#→....\". The '→' is at the center, so the current position is R11(11,13) and direction is RIGHT (100). The front tile is to the right (x+1), which is (12,13). Looking at the ascii_patch, the center is at row 4, column 4 (since radius=4, 9x9 grid). The center row is \"XXX#→....\". The '→' is at the center, so the center is (11,13). The front tile (right) is the next character to the right of '→', which is '.' in the string \"XXX#→....\". So front_tile is '.' (floor). STRAFE_LEFT for direction RIGHT means moving UP (since right_vector for RIGHT is DOWN, so STRAFE_LEFT is UP). But moving UP from (11,13) would be to (11,12), which is in the ascii_patch row 3 (index 3) as \"XXX#....T\". The character at (11,12) is '.' (floor). However, the task common_task_3 is at R10(12,6), which is in a different room (R10 vs R11). The current room is R11. The tasks are in R10 and R00. So we need to move towards the door to R10. Looking at the ascii_patch, there's an open door 'O' at row 1, column 5 (\"#####O###\"), which is (11,1) in the grid? Wait, the ascii_patch rows are from top to bottom, so row 0 is top, row 8 is bottom. The center is at row 4, column 4. So the grid is 9x9, with center at (4,4). The coordinates in the ascii_patch are relative to the center. The center is R11(11,13). So the top-left of the patch is (11-4, 13-4) = (7,9).

Current position R11(12,11). Tasks: common_task_3 at R10(12,6) and long_task_11 at R10(14,8). Front tile is floor, so moving forward (UP) will get closer to tasks. BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is MOVE_FORWARD (0), but it's not in ALLOWED_ACTIONS. Instead, OPEN_DOOR (9) is suggested and valid since front tile is open door? Wait, let's check the ascii_patch. The ascii_patch shows '↑' at center, and rows: [\"XX#....XX\", \"XX#.P.XXX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"####O####\", \"XX#.↑P...\", \"XX#....T.\", \"XX#.....T\", \"XXO....P.\", \"X.#....TP\"]. The center is R11(12,11) with '↑' (facing UP). The front tile (UP from R11(12,11)) is R11(12,10). Looking at the ascii_patch rows: the row for y=11 is the 4th row (index 3) which is \"####O####\". But wait, the ascii_patch rows are centered at R11(12,11), so the rows are from y=11-4 to y=11+4? Let's see: the ascii_patch has 9 rows (radius 4). The center row is the 5th row (index 4) which is \"XX#.↑P...\". So the center is at row 4, column 4 (since it's a 9x9 grid). The center character is '↑', which is the player facing UP. The front tile (UP direction) would be the tile above the center, which is row 3, column 4. Looking at row 3 (index 3): \"####O####\". The character at column 4 (center column) is 'O'? Wait, let's index the ascii_patch rows properly. The ascii_patch rows are: [\"XX#....XX\", \"XX#.P.XXX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"####O####\", \"XX#.↑P...\", \"XX#....T.\", \"XX#.....T\", \"XXO....P.\", \"X.#....TP\"]. The center is R11(12,11), so the rows are from y=11-4=7 to y=11+4=15? But the coordinates might be different. Alternatively, the ascii_patch is a 9x9 grid centered at R11(12,11). So the center is at (4,4) in the ascii_patch. The direction is UP (103), so front is north (up in the grid). In the ascii_patch, the center is at row 4, column 4. The front tile (UP) would be row 3, column 4. Looking at row 3 (index 3): \"####O####\". The 4th character (index 4) is 'O'? Let's count: \"####O####\" has 9 characters. Index 0: '#', 1: '#', 2: '#', 3: '#', 4: 'O', 5: '#', 6: '#', 7: '#', 8: '#'. So at row 3, column 4 is 'O'. But 'O' is an open door. However, the current position is R11(12,11), and the front tile (UP) is R11(12,10)? Wait, the coordinate system: x_right_y_down. So moving UP decreases y. So from R11(12,11), moving UP (direction 103) would go to (12,10). But in the ascii_patch, the center is R11(12,11). The row above the center (UP) is the row with y=10. Looking at the ascii_patch rows: the rows are listed from top to bottom. The first row is the topmost (highest y? or lowest y? Wait, in the coordinate system, origin is top-left, so y increases downward. So the top row of the ascii_patch is the smallest y. The center is R11(12,11), so the ascii_patch rows are from y=11-4=7 to y=11+4=15? But the ascii_patch has 9 rows. Let's assume the first row is y=7, second y=8, ..., 5th row y=11 (center), 6th y=12, etc. But the ascii_patch rows: [\"XX#....XX\", \"XX#.P.XXX\", \"XX#...XXX\", \"####O####\", \"XX#.↑P...\", \"XX#....T.\", \"XX#.....T\", \"XXO....P.\", \"X.#....TP\"]. The center is at row 4 (0-indexed), which is \"XX#.↑P...\". The '↑' is at the center of that row. So the center of the ascii_patch is at row 4, column 4. The character at row 4, column 4 is '↑', which is the player. The front tile (UP) would be row 3, column 4. Row 3 is \"####O####\". Column 4 of that row is 'O'. So the front tile is 'O' (open door). But the current position is R11(12,11), and the front tile (UP) is R11(12,10)? Wait, the coordinate system: x is horizontal (right), y is vertical (down). So moving UP decreases y. So from (12,11), moving UP would go to (12,10). The ascii_patch row for y=10 would be the row above the center. Since the center is at y=11, the row above is y=10. In the ascii_patch, the rows are ordered from top (smallest y) to bottom (largest y). So the first row is y=7, second y=8, third y=9, fourth y=10, fifth y=11 (center), sixth y=12, etc. So row index 3 is y=10. The string for row index 3 is \"####O####\". The center column (x=12) would be at column index 4. So the character at (x=12, y=10) is 'O'. So front_tile is 'O'. Now, the ALLOWED_ACTIONS include OPEN_DOOR (9). But OPEN_DOOR is valid only if front tile is 'D' (closed door). Here, front tile is 'O' (open door), so OPEN_DOOR is not valid. Wait, but the legend says: ", "tasks": [{"task_name": "common_task_3", "steps_required": 3, "position": "R10(12,6)", "progress": "0/3", "completed": false}, {"task_name": "long_task_11", "steps_required": 13, "position": "R10(14,8)", "progress": "0/13", "completed": false}], "finished_tasks": ["short_task_1"], "rows": ["#####################", "#.........#.........#", "#.........#.........#", "#.T.......O.........#", "#.........#.........#", "#.T.......#.....T...#", "#.........#.T...T...#", "#.........#.........#", "#...TT....#.P.T.....#", "#.........#.........#", "######O#####O########", "#.........#.↑P.....P#", "#......T..#....T....#", "#.........#.....T...#", "#...T..T..O....P..T.#", "#.........#....TP...#", "#.........#.........#", "#.........#.........#", "#..T......#.........#", "#....P....#.........#", "#####################"], "visible_tasks": {"R10(12,6)": "common_task_3", "R00(5,8)": "common_task_10", "R11(15,15)": "short_task_1", "R01(7,14)": "short_task_2", "R10(16,5)": "short_task_12", "R00(2,3)": "short_task_9", "R11(16,13)": "short_task_6", "R01(3,18)": "short_task_14", "R10(16,6)": "short_task_13", "R01(4,14)": "long_task_7", "R11(15,12)": "long_task_8", "R00(4,8)": "long_task_15", "R10(14,8)": "long_task_11", "R00(2,5)": "long_task_4", "R01(7,12)": "long_task_16", "R11(18,14)": "long_task_5"}, "visible_players": {"R10(12,8)": {"player_name": "player_1", "direction": 101}, "R11(15,14)": {"player_name": "player_2", "direction": 103}, "R11(16,15)": {"player_name": "player_3", "direction": 103}, "R01(5,19)": {"player_name": "player_4", "direction": 100}, "R11(13,11)": {"player_name": "player_6", "direction": 102}, "R11(19,11)": {"player_name": "player_7", "direction": 103}}}, {"i": 265, "step": 265, "player": "player_5", "position": "R11(12,11)", "direction": 103, "action": 0, "action_name": "MOVE_FORWARD", "thought": "Front tile is open door (O).

TASKS_TO_COMPLETE is empty, so no task to do. Previous steps showed oscillation between (13,8) and (13,9) with MOVE_FORWARD and MOVE_BACKWARD. To avoid oscillation, I should move forward to explore new area. Moving forward will take me to (13,10) which is walkable and not previously visited in recent steps. However, the current step shows oscillation alert, so I need to break the loop by changing direction or moving to a different path. Since front tile is walkable, moving forward is still valid, but I should check if there's a better action to avoid oscillation. Looking at the ascii_patch, the area below (13,10) might be blocked or have a door. Let me check the ascii_patch rows: row 4 is 'X#...T...' which means at (13,10) it's floor, but row 5 is '###O#####' which is a door. However, the front tile is currently floor, so moving forward is safe. But to avoid oscillation, I should not just keep moving forward and backward. Maybe I should turn right or left to explore a different direction. The ascii_patch shows that to the right (east) there might be more open space. Let me check the current direction: facing down (101). Right would be east (100). So turning right might allow me to move east and explore new areas. Alternatively, I could turn left to west, but the ascii_patch shows walls on the left side. Looking at the ascii_patch rows: the first character is 'X' which is unseen, then '#' for wall. So the left side is blocked. The right side might be open. Let me check the ascii_patch for the current position. The center is R10(13,9), and the rows are from row -4 to +4 relative to center. The center row is 'X#..↓....' which means at (13,9) we are facing down. The row above center (row -1) is 'X#...T...' which is row 8 of the grid? Wait, the ascii_patch rows are listed as: [\"X#.....T.\", \"X#.T...T.\", \"X#.......\", \"X#...T...\", \"X#..↓....\", \"###O#####\", \"X#.XXXXXX\", \"X#.XXXXXX\", \"X#XXXXXXX\"] and the center is the 5th row (index 4) which is 'X#..↓....'. So the center is at row 4, column 4 (since it's a 9x9 patch). The '↓' is at the center of the patch, so the center is (13,9). The rows are: row0: X#.....T. -> columns 0-8: X # . . . . . T . row1: X#.T...T. row2: X#....... row3: X#...T... row4: X#..↓.... -> here, the '↓' is at column 4, so the center is (13,9). row5: ###O##### row6: X#.XXXXXX row7: X#.XXXXXX row8: X#XXXXXXX Now, the front tile is at (13,10) which is row4, column5. In row4: 'X#..↓....' -> the characters are: index0: 'X', index1: '#', index2: '.', index3: '.', index4: '↓', index5: '.', index6: '.', index7: '.', index8: '.' So front tile is '.' (floor). But looking at row5: '###O#####' -> this is the row below the center (since center is row4, row5 is one down). So at (13,10) is floor, but below that (13,11) is part of row5. In row5, the columns: index0: '#', index1: '#', index2: '#', index3: 'O', index4: '#', index5: '#', index6: '#', index7: '#', index8: '#' So at (13,11) the tile is '#'? Wait, no. The row5 is for y=10? Let's map the coordinates. The center is R10(13,9). The ascii_patch rows are from y=9-4=5 to y=9+4=13? But the rows are listed as 9 rows. The center row is the 5th row (index 4) which is the row for y=9. So: row0: y=5 row1: y=6 row2: y=7 row3: y=8 row4: y=9 (center) row5: y=10 row6: y=11 row7: y=12 row8: y=13 Now, the front tile is at (13,10) which is x=13, y=10. In the ascii_patch, for row5 (y=10), the columns: index0: 'X' -> x=9? Wait, the ascii_patch is a 9x9 grid centered at (13,9). So the x range is from 13-4=9 to 13+4=17. y range from 9-4=5 to 9+4=13. So: row0 (y=5): x=9 to 17: ", "tasks": [], "finished_tasks": ["short_task_1", "common_task_3", "long_task_11"], "rows": ["#####################", "#.........#.........#", "#.........#P........#", "#.T.......O.........#", "#.........#.........#", "#.T.......#.....T...#", "#.........#.T...T...#", "#.........#.........#", "#...TT....#...T.....#", "#.........#..↓......#", "######O#####O########", "#.....P...#.........#", "#......T..#....T....#", "#.........#.....T...#", "#...T..T.PO....P..T.#", "#.........#....TPP..#", "#.........#.........#", "#.........#.........#", "#..T......#.........#", "#.........#.........#", "#####################"], "visible_tasks": {"R10(12,6)": "common_task_3", "R00(5,8)": "common_task_10", "R11(15,15)": "short_task_1", "R01(7,14)": "short_task_2", "R10(16,5)": "short_task_12", "R00(2,3)": "short_task_9", "R11(16,13)": "short_task_6", "R01(3,18)": "short_task_14", "R10(16,6)": "short_task_13", "R01(4,14)": "long_task_7", "R11(15,12)": "long_task_8", "R00(4,8)": "long_task_15", "R10(14,8)": "long_task_11", "R00(2,5)": "long_task_4", "R01(7,12)": "long_task_16", "R11(18,14)": "long_task_5"}, "visible_players": {"R01(9,14)": {"player_name": "player_1", "direction": 102}, "R11(15,14)": {"player_name": "player_2", "direction": 103}, "R11(16,15)": {"player_name": "player_3", "direction": 103}, "R01(6,11)": {"player_name": "player_4", "direction": 103}, "R10(11,2)": {"player_name": "player_6", "direction": 102}, "R11(17,15)": {"player_name": "player_7", "direction": 103}}}, {"i": 431, "step": 431, "player": "player_5", "position": "R10(13,8)", "direction": 101, "action": 0, "action_name": "MOVE_FORWARD", "thought": "Current position R10(13,8) facing DOWN (101).

Wait, let's check the ascii_patch rows. Center is R10(13,8), radius 4. Rows: 0: X#....... -> y=4, x=9-13? Wait, center is (13,8), so x from 9 to 17, y from 4 to 12.
