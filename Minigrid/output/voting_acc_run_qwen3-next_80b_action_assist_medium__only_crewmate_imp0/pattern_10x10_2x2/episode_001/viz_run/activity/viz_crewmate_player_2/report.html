Front tile is wall (#), so cannot move forward. Current direction is LEFT, so STRAFE_RIGHT would move DOWN (since for LEFT direction, right_vector is UP, so STRAFE_RIGHT is +UP = DOWN).

Wait, let&#x27;s recalculate: for direction L (102), front_vector is (-1,0). right_vector: for L, right_vector is U (up). So STRAFE_RIGHT = +right_vector = +U = (0,-1), STRAFE_LEFT = -right_vector = -U = (0,1). But front tile is wall, so MOVE_FORWARD is invalid. STRAFE_RIGHT and STRAFE_LEFT: need to check if those tiles are walkable. Current position R10(11,6), direction L (102). STRAFE_RIGHT: +right_vector (U) -&gt; (11,5). STRAFE_LEFT: -right_vector (D) -&gt; (11,7). Let&#x27;s check the ascii_patch: rows are from top to bottom. The center is R10(11,6).

In the ascii_patch, row 3, col 4: &#x27;XXX#.....&#x27; -&gt; row 3 is index 3, col 4 is the 5th character (0-indexed), which is &#x27;.&#x27; (floor). So STRAFE_RIGHT is valid.

STRAFE_RIGHT (down) would move to (11,7). Let&#x27;s see the ascii_patch: row 5, col 4 is &#x27;.&#x27; (floor), so valid. Then from there, we can navigate towards the tasks. The thought should explain why STRAFE_RIGHT is chosen: it&#x27;s the BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION and aligns with task navigation for short_task_9. Also, avoid oscillation: since we were previously doing DO_TASK on common_task_3 which is now completed, and now moving to get to next tasks. Also, the previous step was TURN_BACK, so now moving right (STRAFE_RIGHT) is a new direction. So action=2 (STRAFE_RIGHT). Predicted position: R10(11,7), direction remains 102 (LEFT). Predicted front tile: for direction LEFT, front is left of (11,7) which is (10,7). In ascii_patch, row 5, col 3: &#x27;XXX#.....&#x27; -&gt; row 5 is index 5, col 3 is the 4th character: &#x27;#&#x27; (wall). But we don&#x27;t need to predict front_tile for the next step&#x27;s front, but for the action&#x27;s effect. After STRAFE_RIGHT, position becomes (11,7), direction still 102. Then front_position is (11-1,7) = (10,7). The ascii_patch row 5: &#x27;XXX#.....&#x27; -&gt; index 3 is &#x27;#&#x27; (since row 5: &#x27;XXX#.....&#x27; -&gt; positions: 0:X,1:X,2:X,3:#,4:.,5:.,6:.,7:.,8:.) so col 3 is &#x27;#&#x27;. So predicted_front_tile is &#x27;#&#x27;. front_legend_id: since it&#x27;s wall, null. But for predicted_front_legend_id, it&#x27;s based on the predicted state. Predicted position: R10(11,7), direction 102. Predicted front_position: R10(10,7). Predicted front_tile: &#x27;#&#x27; (wall), so front_legend_id null.

The current position is R00(9,3), and the front tile is &#x27;O&#x27;, which is walkable. Since the front tile is open door, moving forward should be possible. However, the ALLOWED_ACTIONS include OPEN_DOOR (9), but the front tile is &#x27;O&#x27;, so OPEN_DOOR is not valid. The BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is [9], but it&#x27;s not valid. Need to check the actual front tile. The ascii_patch shows &#x27;....→O...&#x27; in the row for center R00(9,3), so the front tile (right of current position) is &#x27;O&#x27;. Since it&#x27;s open, we can move forward. The ALLOWED_ACTIONS include MOVE_FORWARD? Let me check the allowed actions: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]. MOVE_FORWARD is not in allowed actions. Why? Because the front tile is &#x27;O&#x27;, which is walkable, so MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed. But it&#x27;s not in the allowed actions. Maybe the front tile is not walkable? Wait, &#x27;O&#x27; is open door, which is walkable. So why is MOVE_FORWARD not in allowed actions? Let me check the ascii_patch again. The ascii_patch rows: [&#x27;#########&#x27;, &#x27;.....#XX.&#x27;, &#x27;.....#...&#x27;, &#x27;....→O...&#x27;, &#x27;.....#...&#x27;, &#x27;.....#XX.&#x27;, &#x27;.....#XXX&#x27;, &#x27;.....#XXX&#x27;]. The center is R00(9,3), and the direction is RIGHT (100). The row for the center is &#x27;....→O...&#x27;, which means the current position is at the &#x27;→&#x27; which is the player. The player is at R00(9,3), and the direction is RIGHT. So the front tile is to the right of the player. In the string &#x27;....→O...&#x27;, the &#x27;→&#x27; is at position 4 (if we count from 0), so the next character is &#x27;O&#x27; at position 5. So front tile is &#x27;O&#x27;. Since &#x27;O&#x27; is walkable, MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed. But the allowed actions are [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]. MOVE_FORWARD (0) is not there. Why? Maybe because the front tile is &#x27;O&#x27;, but the player is not allowed to move into an open door? No, open doors are walkable.

But ascii_patch row 5 is &#x27;#########&#x27;, so (9,20) is wall. So both STRAFE_LEFT and STRAFE_RIGHT might be blocked? But ALLOWED_ACTIONS are [1,3,4,5,6,7]. So STRAFE_RIGHT (2) is not in ALLOWED_ACTIONS. Only STRAFE_LEFT (3) is allowed for strafing? Let&#x27;s check: ALLOWED_ACTIONS: [&lt;LLM_Actions.MOVE_BACKWARD: 1&gt;, &lt;LLM_Actions.STRAFE_LEFT: 3&gt;, &lt;LLM_Actions.TURN_LEFT: 4&gt;, &lt;LLM_Actions.TURN_RIGHT: 5&gt;, &lt;LLM_Actions.TURN_BACK: 6&gt;, &lt;LLM_Actions.NOOP: 7&gt;]. So STRAFE_RIGHT (2) is not allowed. So only STRAFE_LEFT (3) is available for strafing. But what is the tile at (9,18)? From ascii_patch: row 4 is &#x27;....→#XXX&#x27; -&gt; the center is at index 4 (the &#x27;→&#x27;). So the string has 9 characters. The center is (9,19). The tile to the north (up) is row 3 of the ascii_patch. Row 3: &#x27;.....#XXX&#x27; -&gt; index 4 is the center of that row? No, the ascii_patch is a 5x9 grid? Wait, the ascii_patch has 6 rows?

Front tile is wall (#), so cannot move forward. Current direction is LEFT, so STRAFE_RIGHT would move DOWN (since for LEFT direction, right_vector is UP, so STRAFE_RIGHT is +UP = DOWN). But front tile is wall, so STRAFE_RIGHT is invalid. STRAFE_LEFT would move UP (since for LEFT, right_vector is UP, so STRAFE_LEFT is -UP = DOWN? Wait, let's recalculate: for direction L (102), front_vector is (-1,0). right_vector: for L, right_vector is U (up). So STRAFE_RIGHT = +right_vector = +U = (0,-1), STRAFE_LEFT = -right_vector = -U = (0,1). But front tile is wall, so MOVE_FORWARD is invalid. STRAFE_RIGHT and STRAFE_LEFT: need to check if those tiles are walkable. Current position R10(11,6), direction L (102). STRAFE_RIGHT: +right_vector (U) -> (11,5). STRAFE_LEFT: -right_vector (D) -> (11,7). Let's check the ascii_patch: rows are from top to bottom. The center is R10(11,6). The ascii_patch rows: 0: 'XXX#.....', 1: 'XXXX.....', 2: 'XXX#.....', 3: 'XXX#.....', 4: 'XXX#←T...', 5: 'XXX#.....', 6: 'XXX#.P.T.', 7: 'XXX#.....', 8: '#####O###'. The center is at row 4, column 4 (since radius=4, 9x9 grid). The center is '←' which is you facing left. The row 4: 'XXX#←T...' -> positions: index 0: 'X', 1: 'X', 2: 'X', 3: '#', 4: '←', 5: 'T', 6: '.', 7: '.', 8: '.' So the center (11,6) is at row 4, col 4. The front tile (left) is col 3, row 4: '#' (wall). STRAFE_RIGHT: for direction L, right_vector is U (up), so STRAFE_RIGHT moves up: from (11,6) to (11,5). In the ascii_patch, row 3, col 4: 'XXX#.....' -> row 3 is index 3, col 4 is the 5th character (0-indexed), which is '.' (floor). So STRAFE_RIGHT is valid. STRAFE_LEFT: for direction L, STRAFE_LEFT is -right_vector = -U = D (down), so (11,7). Row 5, col 4: 'XXX#.....' -> '.' (floor). So both STRAFE_RIGHT and STRAFE_LEFT are valid. But BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is [2] (STRAFE_RIGHT). Also, TASK_NAVIGATION_SUGGESTION_ACTIONS for short_task_9 is 2, which is STRAFE_RIGHT. So we should do STRAFE_RIGHT. The front tile is wall, so DO_TASK is invalid. We need to move to get closer to tasks. short_task_9 is at R00(2,3), long_task_8 is at R11(15,12). Current position R10(11,6). STRAFE_RIGHT (down) would move to (11,7). Let's see the ascii_patch: row 5, col 4 is '.' (floor), so valid. Then from there, we can navigate towards the tasks. The thought should explain why STRAFE_RIGHT is chosen: it's the BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION and aligns with task navigation for short_task_9. Also, avoid oscillation: since we were previously doing DO_TASK on common_task_3 which is now completed, and now moving to get to next tasks. Also, the previous step was TURN_BACK, so now moving right (STRAFE_RIGHT) is a new direction. So action=2 (STRAFE_RIGHT). Predicted position: R10(11,7), direction remains 102 (LEFT). Predicted front tile: for direction LEFT, front is left of (11,7) which is (10,7). In ascii_patch, row 5, col 3: 'XXX#.....' -> row 5 is index 5, col 3 is the 4th character: '#' (wall). But we don't need to predict front_tile for the next step's front, but for the action's effect. After STRAFE_RIGHT, position becomes (11,7), direction still 102. Then front_position is (11-1,7) = (10,7). The ascii_patch row 5: 'XXX#.....' -> index 3 is '#' (since row 5: 'XXX#.....' -> positions: 0:X,1:X,2:X,3:#,4:.,5:.,6:.,7:.,8:.) so col 3 is '#'. So predicted_front_tile is '#'. front_legend_id: since it's wall, null. But for predicted_front_legend_id, it's based on the predicted state. Predicted position: R10(11,7), direction 102. Predicted front_position: R10(10,7). Predicted front_tile: '#' (wall), so front_legend_id null. Also, check if there's any task or player at front in predicted state: no, it's wall. So all good. Let's confirm the action: ALLOWED_ACTIONS has STRAFE_RIGHT (2), so valid.

Need to check if there's a closed door ahead or if movement is possible. The visible_tasks show 'long_task_8' at R11(15,12), so need to navigate towards it. The current position is R00(9,3), and the front tile is 'O', which is walkable. Since the front tile is open door, moving forward should be possible.

Let me check the ascii_patch again. The ascii_patch rows: ['#########', '.....#XX.', '.....#...', '....→O...', '.....#...', '.....#XX.', '.....#XXX', '.....#XXX']. The center is R00(9,3), and the direction is RIGHT (100). The row for the center is '....→O...', which means the current position is at the '→' which is the player. The player is at R00(9,3), and the direction is RIGHT. So the front tile is to the right of the player. In the string '....→O...', the '→' is at position 4 (if we count from 0), so the next character is 'O' at position 5. So front tile is 'O'. Since 'O' is walkable, MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed. But the allowed actions are [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]. MOVE_FORWARD (0) is not there. Why? Maybe because the front tile is 'O', but the player is not allowed to move into an open door?

However, OPEN_DOOR (9) is not valid since front tile is already open. Since MOVE_FORWARD is not in allowed actions, but front tile is walkable, there might be an error. But according to the allowed actions provided, only [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9] are allowed. Since front tile is 'O', MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed, but it's not listed. However, the allowed actions include CLOSE_DOOR (10), but front tile is 'O', so CLOSE_DOOR is valid. But the task is to move toward long_task_8, so moving forward is needed. Since MOVE_FORWARD is not in allowed actions, but CLOSE_DOOR is, and front tile is 'O', closing the door might not help. Wait, the allowed actions include CLOSE_DOOR (10), which is valid when front tile is 'O'. But closing the door would block the path, which is not helpful. However, the problem states that MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed if front tile is walkable. But in the allowed actions, MOVE_FORWARD is not present. This is confusing. Let me check the ascii_patch again. The ascii_patch row for center R00(9,3) is '....→O...', so the player is at position 4 (if we count from 0), and the next character is 'O' at position 5. So front tile is 'O'. Since 'O' is walkable, MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed. But the allowed actions provided are [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]. Why is MOVE_FORWARD not there? Maybe because the system has a bug, or perhaps the front tile is not actually walkable? But 'O' is open door, which is walkable. Alternatively, maybe the player is not allowed to move into an open door? But the legend says 'O' is walkable. Let me check the mechanics: 'O' is open door, which is walkable. So MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed. But it's not in the allowed actions. The only possible action that could be taken is CLOSE_DOOR (10), but that would close the door, which is not helpful for moving forward. However, the task is to complete long_task_8, which is at R11(15,12). The current position is R00(9,3), and the front tile is 'O'. If we close the door, then we can't move forward, which is bad. Alternatively, maybe the player should turn to face a different direction to find a path. But the BEST_ACTION_SUGGESTION is [0], which is MOVE_FORWARD, but it's not in allowed actions. This is a problem. Let me check the allowed actions again: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]. So allowed actions are MOVE_BACKWARD, STRAFE_RIGHT, STRAFE_LEFT, TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, TURN_BACK, NOOP, OPEN_DOOR. But the front tile is 'O', so OPEN_DOOR is not valid because OPEN_DOOR is only valid when front tile is 'D'. So OPEN_DOOR (9) is not valid. Therefore, the only valid actions are MOVE_BACKWARD, STRAFE_RIGHT, STRAFE_LEFT, TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, TURN_BACK, NOOP. Since the front tile is 'O', which is walkable, MOVE_FORWARD should be allowed, but it's not in the allowed actions. This suggests a possible error in the allowed actions list. However, as per the problem, we must choose from the provided ALLOWED_ACTIONS. So we have to choose from [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]. But OPEN_DOOR (9) is not valid because front tile is 'O', not 'D'. So the valid actions from the list are [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Now, the goal is to move toward long_task_8 at R11(15,12). The current position is R00(9,3), direction RIGHT. The task is at R11(15,12), which is to the right and down. Since we're facing right, moving forward would be the best, but it's not allowed. So we need to find another way. Maybe we should turn to face down or up to find a path. But the ascii_patch shows that to the right is an open door, and below and above might have walls.

MOVE_FORWARD (0) is allowed but front tile is 'X' (unseen), which is blocked. So MOVE_FORWARD is invalid. Need to turn or strafe. Looking at ascii_patch: rows[4] is 'T...↓#XXX', so at center R00(9,8), the down direction (front) is row 5, column 8? Let me parse the ascii_patch correctly. The ascii_patch rows are centered at R00(9,8). The rows are: [0] '.....#XXX', [1] '.....#XXX', [2] '.....#XXX', [3] '.....#XXX', [4] 'T...↓#XXX', [5] '.....#XXX', [6] '#D#####X#', [7] '.XXXX#XXX', [8] 'XXXXX#XXX'. The center is row 4, column 4 of the patch? Wait, the ascii_patch has 9 rows (radius 4), so rows 0-8. The center is at row 4, column 4. The character at row 4, column 4 is '↓' which is the player's current direction. The front tile (down from current position) is the tile below the center. In the patch, the center is at (4,4) in the patch grid. The down direction from center would be row 5, column 4. Looking at row 5: '.....#XXX' -> the 5th character (index 4) is '.'? Wait, let's index the rows properly. Each row string has 9 characters (since radius 4, 9x9 patch). The center is at (4,4) in the patch. So for row index i (0-8), column index j (0-8), the actual position is (center_x + (j-4), center_y + (i-4))? Wait, no: the ascii_patch rows are given as a list of strings.

Front tile is wall (#). Target long_task_8 at R11(15,12). Need to navigate around wall. STRAFE_LEFT (3) would move north (up), but current y=19, moving north would go to y=18 which is wall (from ascii_patch: rows[4] is '....→#XXX', so at (9,19) facing right, front is (10,19) which is '#'). STRAFE_RIGHT (2) would move south (down), but y=19 is bottom of map? Let's check ascii_patch: rows are 5 rows, center is R01(9,19). Rows: [\".....#XXX\", \".....#XXX\", \".....#XXX\", \".....#XXX\", \"....→#XXX\", \"#########\"]. The center is at row 4 (0-indexed), so row 4 is the center row. The string is '....→#XXX' for row 4. The '→' is at the center, so the string has 9 characters. The center is at index 4 of the string. So positions: x from 5 to 13? Let's map: for row 4 (center row), the string is '....→#XXX' -> indices 0 to 8. The center is at index 4, which is '→'. So the tile at (9,19) is the center. The front tile (right) is index 5, which is '#'. The tile to the left of center (index 3) is '.' (since '....' then '→' at index 4). The tile below center (south) would be in row 5 of the ascii_patch. Row 5 is '#########', so all walls. So moving south (STRAFE_RIGHT) would be into a wall. STRAFE_LEFT (3) would move north (up), which is row 3 of ascii_patch. Row 3 is '.....#XXX', so at index 5 (right of center) is '#', but STRAFE_LEFT is left of center? Wait, let's clarify: when facing right (100), STRAFE_LEFT is north (up), STRAFE_RIGHT is south (down). The current position is R01(9,19). STRAFE_LEFT (3) would move to (9,18) because north is decreasing y. STRAFE_RIGHT (2) would move to (9,20) but y=20 might be out of bounds? But ascii_patch row 5 is '#########', so (9,20) is wall. So both STRAFE_LEFT and STRAFE_RIGHT might be blocked? But ALLOWED_ACTIONS are [1,3,4,5,6,7]. So STRAFE_RIGHT (2) is not in ALLOWED_ACTIONS. Only STRAFE_LEFT (3) is allowed for strafing? Let's check: ALLOWED_ACTIONS: [<LLM_Actions.MOVE_BACKWARD: 1>, <LLM_Actions.STRAFE_LEFT: 3>, <LLM_Actions.TURN_LEFT: 4>, <LLM_Actions.TURN_RIGHT: 5>, <LLM_Actions.TURN_BACK: 6>, <LLM_Actions.NOOP: 7>]. So STRAFE_RIGHT (2) is not allowed. So only STRAFE_LEFT (3) is available for strafing. But what is the tile at (9,18)? From ascii_patch: row 4 is '....→#XXX' -> the center is at index 4 (the '→'). So the string has 9 characters. The center is (9,19). The tile to the north (up) is row 3 of the ascii_patch. Row 3: '.....#XXX' -> index 4 is the center of that row? No, the ascii_patch is a 5x9 grid? Wait, the ascii_patch has 6 rows?
