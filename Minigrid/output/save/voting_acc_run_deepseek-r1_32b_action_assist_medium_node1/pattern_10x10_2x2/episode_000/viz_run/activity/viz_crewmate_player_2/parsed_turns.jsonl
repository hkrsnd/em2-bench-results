But wait, moving forward would take me from (2,5) to (2,4), but looking at the view, in front of me is a '.' which is floor, so it's safe. Alternatively, strafing right would take me to (3,5). Let me check the allowed actions and their outcomes. Moving forward keeps me facing up, while strafing right changes my position but not direction. Since I need to get closer to R00(7,4), which is east of me, moving towards higher x or y? Wait, in this grid system, how do directions translate? If I'm at (2,5) and facing up (direction 103), then forward would decrease the y-coordinate. So from (2,5) to (2,4). But common_task_1 is at (7,4), which is much further east. Maybe moving towards higher x values would help. So strafing right increases x by 1, so that's better for getting closer to x=7. Alternatively, turning left or right might change my direction to face east or south, allowing me to move forward in the desired direction. Let me see: if I turn right (action 5), my direction becomes 100, which is facing right (east). Then moving forward would take me from (2,5) to (3,5), which is closer to x=7. That seems better. So perhaps turning right and then moving forward multiple times would be the way to go. But I have to make sure there are no obstacles in that path. Looking at my current view, the ascii patch shows rows around me. The center is R00(2,5), radius 4. The rows show that directly ahead (y decreases) is all '.' up to a certain point, but moving east might be blocked by walls or other players? Wait, in the visible_tasks, common_task_1 is at R00(7,4). So from my current position, I need to move east and maybe slightly north. But since I'm facing up (north), turning right would face me east, allowing me to move forward towards higher x values. Let's plan: turn right (action 5) to face east, then move forward multiple times until I reach closer to the task. Alternatively, strafing right now would take me to (3,5), which is a step in the right direction without changing my facing. But if I keep strafing right, I might not be able to see obstacles ahead. Maybe turning right first is safer because then moving forward will directly head towards higher x. Let's check the action outcomes: turning right (action 5) would change my direction to 100 (east), position remains R00(2,5). Then, moving forward from there would take me to R00(3,5). That seems manageable. So perhaps the best first step is to turn right and then move forward. But since I can only choose one action per step, maybe turning right now is the priority. Alternatively, if I move forward now, I go to (2,4), which might not be as helpful for reaching x=7. Hmm. Maybe moving towards higher x is more important. So perhaps strafing right (action 2) would take me to R00(3,5). That's a step east without changing my facing. Then in the next step, I can decide whether to turn or continue strafing. Alternatively, turning right now and then moving forward could be more efficient. Let me consider both options: Option 1: Turn right (action 5) -> face east. Next step, move forward to (3,5).

If I strafe right now, I'm at (3,5) but still facing up; next step could be to move forward or continue strafing. But perhaps turning right and then moving forward is more efficient because it aligns my direction with the target's x-axis. So maybe action 5 (turn right) is better as the first step. Alternatively, if I'm concerned about obstacles in front when facing east, but according to the view, from R00(2,5), looking east at radius 4, there are no walls or players blocking that path immediately.
